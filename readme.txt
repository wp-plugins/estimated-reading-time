= How is the estimation done? =

The estimation is based on a span of 150 words per minute 
(slightly slower than average) to 250 words per minute 
(slightly higher than average).  These numbers can be 
changed easily from within the code of the plugin 
(lowered to account for more complex content and raised 
for simpler content).  Future versions of the plugin 
may allow for the changing of these parameters via 
an "options" page.
